Tilt File Sync to Persistent Volume Demo ðŸ”„
This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Tilt to live-sync a local file into a Kubernetes pod that is backed by a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

This pattern is useful for development environments where you need to rapidly iterate on code or configuration files that must exist on a persistent volume, without rebuilding a container image for every change.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed and running:

Tilt: For orchestrating the development environment.

A local Kubernetes cluster: Such as minikube, Docker Desktop, or k3d.

Docker: Or another container runtime compatible with your Kubernetes cluster.

kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool.

How to Run the Demo
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Jfortunati/tilt-local-demo-local-file.git
cd tilt-local-demo-local-file
Start your Kubernetes cluster: If you're using minikube, simply run:

Bash

minikube start
Launch Tilt: Run tilt up from the root of the project directory. Tilt will open in your web browser and begin setting up the resources.

Bash

tilt up
Verifying the Sync
Once tilt up is running and all resources in the UI are green, you can test the file synchronization.

Check the initial file contents: The Tiltfile first copies the local sync_probe.txt into the pod. You can verify its contents with kubectl exec:

Bash

kubectl exec -n testkube -it deploy/tilt-syncer -- cat /data/repo/sync_probe.txt
Modify the local file: Open the local sync_probe.txt file in your text editor, change the text, and save it.

Verify the change in the pod: Almost instantly, Tilt will sync the change. Run the kubectl exec command again, and you'll see the updated content inside the pod. This happens without a pod restart.



How It Works
Tiltfile: This is the main script that orchestrates the entire process. It creates the PVC, builds the Docker image, deploys the resources to Kubernetes, and sets up the live sync.

k8s/pvc.yaml: A manifest that defines the PersistentVolumeClaim to provide stable storage.

k8s/syncer.yaml: A Kubernetes Deployment that runs a simple pod. This pod mounts the PVC at the /data/repo path.

Dockerfile.tilt-syncer: A minimal Dockerfile that creates the /data/repo directory where the volume will be mounted.

sync_probe.txt: The sample file on your local machine that gets synced into the pod.

Cleanup
To stop the live-sync and remove the Kubernetes resources created by Tilt, press (Ctrl + C) in the terminal where tilt up is running, or run:

Bash

tilt down
